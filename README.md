Dark Energy School LSS Statistics
=================================

Support Material for David Kirkby's lecture on *Using Statistics to Describe Large-Scale Structure in the Universe* at the [February 2015 Dark Energy School](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LSSTDESC/DE+School#DESchool-DESchoolFeb2015). This material is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/DESchool_LSS_Stats/blob/master/LICENSE).

Start with the `LargeScaleStructureStatistics` iPython notebook (viewable online [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/DESchool_LSS_Stats/blob/master/LargeScaleStructureStatistics.ipynb)). There are also some folders:
* camb: Stuff related to the Planck 2013 fiducial cosmology.
* alt: Data files for alternative cosmologies used in one of the exercises.
* plots: The iPython notebook saves its plots here.
* tex: Equations used in the talk and generated with LaTeX.

The red and blue handouts for the first exercise are included and the final spreadsheet (read-only) generated during the school is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CZpHrB7J6-AgwBXX0CKRHnztI3M2zWHOaA4QliosQJ8/edit?usp=sharing).
